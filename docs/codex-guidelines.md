# Codex Collaboration Guidelines

These notes document the working agreement between the user and Codex when editing this repository.

## Content Editing Rules

- Codex updates may focus on layout, styling, refactors, infrastructure, or other functional changes.
- Codex must **not** rewrite or adjust copy/content without explicit user approval. Any suggestions for wording changes should be raised as proposals instead of being applied directly.

Please keep this file up to date if additional collaboration rules are established.
